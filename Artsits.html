<h3> My favorite Lyrics</h3>
<p2>"live action from the door/Shawty dime, let the whole team smash her on the tour/I splash bravado, fast cash aficionado/Savage vandal, I'm a legend of tomorrow/Painting the truth, here's proof, ain't it the truth/So ill a nigga spit with a containment suit" - Inspectah Deck</p2>

<p1>Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur and fashion designer. His musical career has been marked by dramatic changes in styles, incorporating an eclectic range of influences from soul, baroque-pop, electro, indie rock, synth-pop, industrial and gospel. Over the course of his career, West has been responsible for cultural movements and progressions within mainstream hip hop and popular music at large.
</br>
</br>

Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West first became known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing hit singles for recording artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris and Alicia Keys. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to widespread critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He went on to experiment with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and the polarizing but influential 808s & Heartbreak (2008). He released his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2010 to further rave reviews, and has since succeeded it with Yeezus (2013) and The Life of Pablo (2016), as well as full-length collaborations Watch the Throne (2011) and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Jay-Z and Kid Cudi respectively.
West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. His marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian has also been a source of substantial media attention. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.

	<h3>The Editor's Segment</h3>
	<p2>I came across Kendrick from another Hip Hop Head friend of mine as he recommended his album ’To Pimp A Butterfly’ this album was a weird one for me as I had never heard Jazz be the lead in a hip hop album as I got to the 3rd listen of this album I became very appreciative of the album’s sentimental value for what Kendrick actually talks about on this album, as he goes through relationships, politics and just straight up finessing in such a beautiful way that It shot this album to the top of my favorite album ever.

<h3>The Editor's Segment</h3>
<p2>I came across Logic through the weird Youtube algorithm Hearing his ‘The Incredible True Story’ concept album taking me on a trip to outer space in the post planet earth humanity. His rhymes and lyrical play and just his strictly original creativity was what had really drawn me to him.
